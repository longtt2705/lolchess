# Database Page Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive Champion and Item Database page that displays all game data fetched from backend API endpoints with search functionality and beautiful UI.

## Files Created

### 1. `/apps/frontend/src/types/database.ts`
Type definitions for Champion and Item data structures:
- `ChampionData`: Complete champion stats, skills, and auras
- `ItemData`: Item properties, effects, recipes
- `ItemEffect`: Effect modifiers and types
- `AttackRange`: Range configuration for attacks
- Supporting interfaces for skills, stats, and auras

### 2. `/apps/frontend/src/pages/DatabasePage.tsx`
Main database page component with:
- **Tab Navigation**: Switch between Champions and Items views
- **API Integration**: Fetches data from backend endpoints
- **Search Functionality**: Real-time filtering by name for both tabs
- **Loading States**: Spinner while fetching data
- **Error Handling**: Retry button on API failures
- **Responsive Design**: Grid layouts that adapt to screen size

## Files Modified

### 3. `/apps/frontend/src/App.tsx`
- Added import for `DatabasePage`
- Added route `/database` for the Database page

### 4. `/apps/frontend/src/components/Header.tsx`
- Added import for `Database` icon from lucide-react
- Added "Database" navigation link between "Rules" and "1v1 Lobby"

## Features Implemented

### Champions Tab
- **Grid Display**: 20+ champions in responsive card layout
- **Champion Cards** show:
  - Champion icon (with fallback emoji if image fails)
  - Name prominently displayed
  - Stats grid: HP, AD, AP, Speed, Physical Res, Magic Res
  - Attack Range with formatted display (range + directions)
  - Skill section with:
    - Skill name and type badge (Active/Passive)
    - Description
    - Cooldown information
  - Aura section (if champion has aura)
- **Search**: Real-time filtering by champion name
- **Animations**: Staggered entrance animations for cards

### Items Tab
- **Two Sections**: Basic Items and Combined Items
- **Item Cards** show:
  - Item icon
  - Item name with UNIQUE badge if applicable
  - Cost (for basic items) in gold
  - Effects list with formatted stats (+10 AD, etc.)
  - Description (special effects in italics)
  - Recipe display for combined items (Item1 + Item2 → Result)
- **Search**: Real-time filtering by item name
- **Visual Recipe**: Shows which basic items combine into advanced items
- **Animations**: Entrance animations for item cards

### API Integration
Connected to backend endpoints:
- `GET /games/champions` - Fetches all champion data
- `GET /games/items?type=basic` - Fetches basic items (8 items)
- `GET /games/items?type=combined` - Fetches combined items (60+ items)

**Note**: Backend runs on port 3001 by default.

### Styling & Design
Follows project guidelines strictly:
- Uses CSS variables throughout (--gold, --primary-bg, --secondary-bg, --border, etc.)
- Card-based layout with hover effects
- Consistent padding (20px, 32px) and border-radius (8px, 12px)
- Gradient backgrounds and buttons
- Framer Motion animations for smooth transitions
- Loading spinner matching app style
- Responsive grid layouts

## Navigation
The Database page is accessible from:
1. **Header**: "Database" link (always visible)
2. **Direct URL**: `/database`

## Technical Details

### Data Flow
1. Component mounts and dispatches `fetchDatabaseData()`
2. Redux async thunk makes three parallel API calls using axios
3. Data stored in Redux global state (champions, basicItems, combinedItems)
4. Component subscribes to Redux state via `useAppSelector`
5. Search filters applied client-side for instant results
6. Tab switching shows/hides relevant data
7. Loading and error states managed by Redux

### Helper Functions
- `formatAttackRange()`: Formats attack range object into readable string
- `formatEffects()`: Converts effect objects into display strings
- `getItemNameById()`: Looks up item names from IDs for recipe display

### Error Handling
- Try-catch blocks for all API calls
- Error state with retry button
- Loading state with spinner
- Graceful fallbacks for missing images

## Build Status
Successfully built with no errors:
```
✓ 1779 modules transformed
✓ built in 4.87s
```

## Usage
To view the database:
1. Start the backend server (must be running on localhost:3001)
2. Start the frontend development server
3. Navigate to `/database` or click "Database" in the header
4. Switch between Champions and Items tabs
5. Use search bars to filter by name

## Future Enhancements
Potential improvements:
- Advanced filtering (by stats, cost ranges, skill type)
- Sorting options (by name, stats, cost)
- Detailed modal views for champions/items
- Comparison tool for multiple champions
- Favorites/bookmarking system
- Champion ability videos or animations
- Item build path visualizations
