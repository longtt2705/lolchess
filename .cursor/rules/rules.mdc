## Development Environment
- Always run `fnm use v22` before doing any development work to ensure using Node.js version 22
- Verify the correct Node version with `node --version` after switching

## Server Management
- **NEVER start development servers automatically** (npm run dev, npm start, etc.)
- The user always starts servers manually themselves
- Only provide instructions on how to start servers, don't execute the commands
- Focus on code changes, builds, and testing without starting servers

## Project Structure
- This is a monorepo with NestJS backend and React frontend
- Use workspace commands when needed: `npm run build --workspace=apps/backend`
- Always work from the project root directory: `/Users/long.tt/code/lolchess`

## Preferred Workflow
1. Switch to Node v22 with `fnm use v22`
2. Make code changes and improvements
3. Test builds: `npm run build`
4. Let the user start servers manually when they're ready
5. Must follow the rules in the RULE.md file for game design
6. Every API in the Frontend must be use Redux slice
