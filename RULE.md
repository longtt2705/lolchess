# League of Legends Chess - Official Rulebook

## 1. GAME OBJECTIVE
The primary objective of League of Legends Chess is to defeat the opponent's **Poro**. The player who successfully slays the opposing Poro wins the game.

## 2. THE BOARD & SETUP
* **The Board:** The game is played on a 10x10 grid. The standard 8x8 chessboard (files 'a' through 'h' and ranks 1 through 8) is used for standard piece setup. Two additional files, 'z' and 'i', are added to the left and right of the standard board, respectively.
* **Special Squares:**
    * `z5`: The **Baron Nashor** pit.
    * `i4`: The **Drake** pit.
* **Sides:** Instead of White and Black, the players are designated as the **Blue Side** (starting on ranks 1 & 2) and the **Red Side** (starting on ranks 7 & 8).
* **Initial Piece Setup:**
    * **Rank 1 (Blue) / Rank 8 (Red):**
        * `a1/a8` & `h1/h8`: Siege Minion (Rook)
        * `b1/b8` & `g1/g8`: Champion 1 & 2 (Knight positions)
        * `c1/c8` & `f1/f8`: Champion 3 & 4 (Bishop positions)
        * `d1/d8`: Champion 5 (Queen position)
        * `e1/e8`: Poro (King position)
    * **Rank 2 (Blue) / Rank 7 (Red):** 6 Melee Minions (b2->g2 & b7->g7) + 2 Caster Minions (a2/a7 & h2/h7)

## 3. PHASE 1: BAN & PICK
Before the game begins, players engage in a champion selection phase.
1.  **Ban Phase:** Starting with the Blue Side, each player bans one champion, alternating until a total of 4 champions are banned (2 per player). Banned champions cannot be picked.
2.  **Pick Phase:** Starting with the Blue Side, players pick champions one by one in a snake draft format (Blue-Red-Red-Blue-Blue-Red, etc.) until each player has selected 5 champions. These 5 champions will take the place of the traditional Knights, Bishops, and Queen pieces.

* **Castle:** If the piece is a Poro and it has not moved before, it can castle with a Siege Minion. The Siege Minion must be in the same rank as the Poro and not have moved before. The Poro can move 2 squares horizontally and the Siege Minion will move to the other side of the Poro.

### Combat
When a piece attacks another, damage is calculated.
* **Critical Strike:** A critical strike deals 150% damage (or the attacker's Critical Damage percentage if modified).

  4. Resistance is applied (Physical Resistance for AD damage, Magic Resistance for AP damage), reduced by Sunder if applicable
  5. Final damage is subtracted from defender's HP
* **Lifesteal:** If the attacker has lifesteal, they heal for a percentage of the AD damage dealt (after resistances).

The damage is subtracted from the defender's HP. If a piece's HP drops to 0 or below, it is slain and removed from the board. The attacking player gains Gold equal to the slain piece's Gold Value. The defending piece does not deal damage back unless a special ability is involved.
